# Communication Guidelines

## Output Style

- Be concise and direct
- Use code examples over lengthy explanations
- Format output for terminal readability
- Use markdown for structure

## When Explaining

- Start with the "what" before the "why"
- Use bullet points for multiple items
- Include command examples when relevant
- Reference file paths with line numbers

## Documentation

- Document the "why" not the "what"
- Keep comments minimal and meaningful
- Update docs when changing functionality
- Use JSDoc/docstrings for public APIs only
